# Raspbery PI 
In this folder there are 4 subfolders each containing materials for testing the system
- CRC: Contains the CRC encoder as a python file
- Full_system_simulation RPI: Contains the sender and receiver code for the full system test without the FPGA connected, but rather the RPI simulating the CRC code, original on the FPGA
- Lossless compression: Contains the code for a lossless compression test conducted in the repport
- compression - UART: Contains the code for using the UART onboard the RPI as sender and receiver
